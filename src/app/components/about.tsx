          I am a Vancouverite, born and raised. My off-beat last name comes from
          my grandfather, who immigrated to New Zealand, where both of my
          parents hail from. I have a strong desire to be a team player and
          strive to leave a positive impact wherever I go. Outside of
          programming, I spend my leisure time exercising, trying new food, and
          studying investments
